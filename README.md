# OpenAI and Eleven Labs API Integration

Welcome to the OpenAI and Eleven Labs API Integration repository! This project showcases the seamless collaboration between OpenAI's powerful language models and Eleven Labs API to handle audio processing. The script in this repository demonstrates a comprehensive workflow involving English audio transcription, summarization, translation to Spanish, and the generation of a corresponding Spanish audio file.

## Workflow Overview

### Step 1: Transcription with OpenAI
Leverage OpenAI's advanced language models to transcribe English (or other languages) audio files.

### Step 2: Summarization and Translation with OpenAI
Utilize OpenAI's capabilities to summarize the transcription and translate it into Spanish.

### Step 3: Spanish Audio Generation with Eleven Labs
Employ Eleven Labs API to convert the translated text into an audio file in Spanish. 
Note: this can also be done using OpenAI's Whisper model but ElevenLabs let's you create your own voices.
